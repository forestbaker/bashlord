= Using bashlord =
Let's start with a basic example:

I want to create a shell script to backup my web browser bookmarks.

==Step 1: I will ask bashlord to create a new script==
{{{
bashlord add bkp-bookmarks
}}}

From here a script and an alias have been created. The name of your script is already a command available from your shell. This command execute your script.

==Step 2: I will edit my script==
The following command will open up my script shell in vim, so I will be able to add the commands that perform my backup.
{{{
bashlord edit bkp-bookmarks
}}}

Note: You can configure 'bashlord edit' to open scripts with your favourite editor just replacing 'vim' in the following file: ~âˆ•.bashlord/conf.d/00_bashlord_init

==Step 3: Enjoy it==
Now I can type the following command any time I want to backup my bookmarks
 {{{
bkp-bookmarks
}}}
