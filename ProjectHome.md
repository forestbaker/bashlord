Bashlord allows you to manage a pool of shell scripts.

Usually, Creating shell scripts means proceeding the following fastidious steps :
  1. Create and edit the script file
  1. Change rights on the file to make it executable
  1. Eventually create an alias, so you will be able to execute the script from anywhere through a command.

With bashlord you will be able to **create, edit, list, delete scripts** very easily **in one short command**.
<br />Bashlord script creation **generates an alias automatically** directly accessible as a new command within your system.
